## Disclaimer

**!! MAKE SURE TO CHECK THE VERSION FOR EACH WORKFLOW STEP !!**

---

I make no effort to keep individual Action steps' version tags up to date. You can open any action by copying and pasting the `uses: ` name and adding https://github.com/ before it.

`https://github.com/{owner}/{action-name}`

For example, the URL for the `actions/checkout` Action is [`https://github.com/actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout).
