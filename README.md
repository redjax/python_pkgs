# Python Packages

My monorepo where I keep packages I repeatedly copy/paste into new projects, but that I don't want to publish to Pypi. Most of the files in this repository, including the [`.gitignore`](.gitignore), [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml), and [`ruff.toml`](ruff.toml), can be used as a reference in other projects.

| Repository Directory         | Purpose                                                            | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`libs/`](./libs/)           | Python library code.                                               | Packages in this path are isolated from each other, meaning you can copy the `src/<package_name>` directory from any library package into your project. Check each library's `pyproject.toml`'s `[dendencies]` section to see if you need to install any extra packages.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [`scripts/`](./scripts)      | Re-usable Python scripts, or self-contained (single file) modules. | These scripts are not Python packages, you can just copy/paste them into a file on your machine and run them. Some scripts will start with `# /// script`; this is called "inline metadata," implemented in [PEP723](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/). Tools like [`uv` can use this syntax to run the script and automatically install the required dependencies](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#running-a-script-with-dependencies). |
| [`pipelines/`](./pipelines/) | CI/CD pipeline files.                                              | Pipelines for Github Actions, Woodpecker CI, and/or Concourse CI (or whatever other pipelines I've used).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
